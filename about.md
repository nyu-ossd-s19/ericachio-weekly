A native New Yorker, staying in New York for college wasn't something I ever regretted because of my love for the city. I love hanging out with friends, both new and old, and trying new foods. I look forward to coding with you! 

### More Information

I enjoy staying indoors because I am afraid of the cold, but when its warm I love going out.
