Thoughts on Guest Speaker, Licenses, Installing...

## Guest Speaker Christos Bacharakis
Listening to guest speaker Christos Bacharakis from Mozilla talk about open source really opened up the idea of open source to me. Prior to this class, I had little to no idea as to what open source really was, and was nervous about contributing to such big projects. However, Christos talked about how welcoming a lot of the communities were and that definetely eased at least some of my worries. Furthermore, the idea of using open source to make connections that eventually lead to a career job was new to me. I didn't realize how impactful or big the open source community was, and Christos exposed me to all those new thoughts.
