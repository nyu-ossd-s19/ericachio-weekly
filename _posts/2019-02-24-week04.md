Project Evaluation on Bokeh...

## Bokeh
The project I picked to do a project evaluation on is Bokeh, a Python interative visualization library. It helps make data visualization more relatable and asthetically pleasing. It allows you to make plots, dashboards, graphs, graphics, and applications. I am interested in this software because I work in a biological lab which has a lot of data computation and visualization. However, sometimes I find it more difficult to follow the data, and would like to try different ways to visualize the data. Since I have a personal interest in this program, I think I would be more invested in contributing to the code.
