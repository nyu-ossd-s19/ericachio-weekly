## Kevin Fleming
I think inner source is an interesting topic because I never really thought about open source being used in proprietary companies and code. It demonstrates the importance of open source because even private companies are using it, and need it. Fleming bringing up the fact that there are a lot of companies that employ open source contributors just to maintain the open source community is very interesting. Overall, I think Fleming was able to really show the importance of open source in his presentation. 

## Progress
This week, I commented on several issues, so it could be further elaborated. The emoji issue I had been previously looking at, I've realized I can't find enough information on accelerators in Electron to fix it. Furthermore, because it isn't an issue on Messenger.com, it is a bug in their added feature.
