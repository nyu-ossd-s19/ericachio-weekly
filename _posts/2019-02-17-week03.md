More on Extensions...


Learning more about extensions this week was interesting. I especially liked listening to other people's extension ideas. It made me realize how many different ideas there can be just from extensions. It made me feel like my extension idea was a little to basic, but I still loved working on my extension. I thought the practicality of it was what made it unique. I also enjoyed working with my team member, Carly. I originally didn't like working with people I didn't know, but I actually liked it a lot better. It allowed me to meet new people and see new perspectives. We often messaged each other to collborate our work instead of meeting because we were both busy. We talked extensively on how we wanted our program would work and would live update the bugs and prolems we encountered. In the end, it was a great experience because it made me more confident in meeting and talking to new people in the class.
