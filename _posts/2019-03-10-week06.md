Thoughts on HFOSS and Project Evaluation...

## Thoughts on HFOSS
I think that HFOSS is both daunting and exciting. It is very exciting because it is such a great tool that can help and impact so many people. Being said, I think that HFOSS are very scary as the are such high impact softwares. Having an issue or a bug could very well have huge real life impacts, something I think as a newer contributor to open source, would be very scary. Furthermore, I believe it would be harder to work on these softwares because it is only used in emergencies, so there wouldn't be as much as a motivation to work on it as softwares that I personally use everyday. However, I still do think that HFOSS are very important and people should contribute to these programs, just maybe not newbies like me.
