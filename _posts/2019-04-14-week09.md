## personal progress
This week, during workshop I worked with my fellow teammates to fix a couple of CSS issues. I found an issue that I have begun working on, in which the emoji menu doesn't automatically close itself after use. I've been trying to find in the code where it is, but haven't had too much luck. I definetely plan to find it before the next workshop, so that I can begin playing around with it.
