My Contributions...


For this group project, I mostly contributed in the issues forum of the project. I commented on issues, and requested a new feature. I also aided in one of the pull requests we made, the gif one, in person. I've also contributed to our excel sheet of issues we thought were tackleable. I also tried to work on one of their bigger issues, the emoji issue.  But, I think I was too ambitious and was never really able to figure it out. In fact, I discovered that there were several issue reports about it. I've debated linking all the emoji issues together, similar to how the compiled all issues of the dark mode together. But, I think each of the emoji issues are slightly different.
