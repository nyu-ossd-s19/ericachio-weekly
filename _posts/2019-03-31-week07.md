First Open Source Project...

## Thoughts on Caprine
This week, my team and I worked on learning the in and outs of Caprine. I have downloaded the app itself so that I could become familiar with the user side of the app. This would allow me to find any new bugs and first hand experience some of the more reoccuring bugs - such as dark mode. I've also downloaded the code for Caprine and have been trying to learn the structure of their code. I also plan on reviewing some of the basics of Electron, so that I can have a foundation to help contribute. 

## Wikipedia
I love wikipedia, I think there's a lot of fun in just randomly going through pages. I have personally contributed to some Wiki pages, especially if its about a tv show or movie, such as updating the summary. I find the summaries of consumable media to be the best kind of Wiki pages because it allows me to know the story without actually commiting to a long time watching it. Thus, I like to add to it whenever I watched something and the Wiki page is a bit empty. I think the people who update Wiki pages are definitely people who are passionate about the pages they are editting.
